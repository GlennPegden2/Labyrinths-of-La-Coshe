Common Subroutines
------------------

9960 - L$ = second parameter
9000 - Unencrypt A$ and print it

Misc
----

Entering your Name (NAM$) as SUPREME CHEATER sets NAM$="HYJL"

Decrypting
----------

Within A$ A-Z are in pairs, first char is pointer to appropriate W$, calculated on the following formula
where x is the first char
((ASC(x) - 64)*10) + 9690
The second char is the number of phrases into W$ the phrase is. 

VH VK VL -# < FK VM:
|| || ||    |___ <CR>
|| ||_||____ As VH
||___ [72] -64 = 8 = Number of words into string  
|___ [86] -64 = 22 : 9690 + 22*10 = 9910 = Line that sets W$

     ; = .
     : = End of string
     < = <CR>
     < 65 and not 58,59,60 (uses z$, see below)

If the value is less than < 65 and not 58,59,60 then Z$ is used instead of W$. 
Z$ contains simple, short words.

W$ is many phrases concatenated, each phrase is separated by an ascii char denoting how long
the phrase is (A = 1, B=2 etc) 


e.g.

Value for W$=
